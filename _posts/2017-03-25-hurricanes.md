Simply put, I should be looking for IT/software developer job listings rather than writing.

I don't even think I enjoy web development too much (seems like half of it is worrying about resolution scaling), but I want to learn an adequate level of JavaScript. I've been reading up about the [Meteor framework](https://meteor.com). It's a nice build platform that's helped me **slowly** learn the JS syntax by trial and error. It reminds me of Jekyll, which I used to make this blog, and how it helps me not have to worry too much about back-end concepts at the moment.

As a demo, I'm working on a simple webapp for people to swap their Nintendo Switch friend codes and organize game matches. A decade-plus ago, I spent a lot of time on a similar LFG website for the Nintendo DS so it's a personal project. The Nintendo Switch social integration is lacking at the moment. Hopefully I'll have something to show by this time next month.

The grace period for my college loans are fast approaching! Exhilarating.

I'm working 40+ hours a week at my retail job to save money for these upcoming payments but I feel like I need some time away from work to focus on getting a new job.

Wow, this post is pretty downtrotten! The stress of needing a decent paying job while still feeling like a subpar developer has been, well, stressful. I still don't know exactly what I want to apply my CompSci degree to. I'm kind of just throwing my resume at applications and hoping it sticks.
