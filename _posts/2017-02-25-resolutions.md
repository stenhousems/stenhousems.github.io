Welcome to my first post! I've spent hours setting this up so I should be compelled to write more often.

My 2017 resolution was to spend five hours a week programming. I'm nine weeks late but here I am with a blog.

This blog was an exercise in learning how to set up a framework:

* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) acts as host
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) executes Ruby voodoo to deploy the website via Liquid templates, HTML, CSS and Markdown
* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) is a very nice Jekyll theme by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) that I will work off of

What all of that results in is *the Michael Stenhouse blog*.

There are several guides on getting these services to work. I read
[this detailed guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to better understand how the Jekyll file hierarchy works.
As I've found out lately, a lot of open source software are not compatible with Windows but getting Jekyll to
[run on Windows](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) wasn't too difficult.

Now that my machine is well-equiped with any Ruby dependencies I may need, I will try to work on a Ruby project in the future.
I would like to work on something substantial that I could show off to employers. Chances are I'll probably continue working
on the Destiny Python shell I wrote for my final project as an undergraduate.

I'd like to write a post every week as a sort of "reaction" to my programming. But I'm going to be realistic:
the [Nintendo Switch](https://youtu.be/f5uik5fgIaI) and the new Zelda are out next week and nothing else will matter
for a few days.
